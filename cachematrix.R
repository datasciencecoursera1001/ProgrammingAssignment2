## This file contains  a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a 
## matrix.  This is for Programming Assignment 2 of Coursera's 
## "R Programming".  Also, these comments borrow heavily from the
## assignment description.

## Create a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix (above). If the inverse has already been 
## calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then 
## cacheSolve will retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
